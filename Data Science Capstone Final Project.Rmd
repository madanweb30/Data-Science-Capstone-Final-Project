## Overview of the Project

The purpose of the project is to create text-prediction application with R Shiny package that predicts words using a natural language processing model i.e. creating an application based on a predictive model for text.
The goal of the project is to build a predictive text model combined with a shiny app UI that will predict the next word as the user types a sentence similar to the way most smart phone keyboards are implemented today using the technology of Swiftkey.

## Getting & Cleaning the Data

Before building the word prediction algorithm, data are first processed and cleaned as steps below:

- A subset of the original data was sampled from the three sources (blogs,twitter and news) which is then merged into one.
- Next, data cleaning is done by conversion to lowercase, strip white space, and removing punctuation and numbers.
- The corresponding n-grams are then created (Quadgram,Trigram and Bigram).
- Next, the term-count tables are extracted from the N-Grams and sorted according to the frequency in descending order.
- Lastly, the n-gram objects are saved as R-Compressed files (.RData files)
- The prediction model uses the principles of tidy data applied to text mining in R


## Word Prediction Model
Explanation of the next word prediction flow is as below:

- Compressed data sets containing descending frequency sorted n-grams are first loaded.
- User input words are cleaned in the similar way as before prior to prediction of the next word.
- For prediction of the next word, Quadgram is first used (first three words of Quadgram are the last three words of the user provided sentence).
- If no Quadgram is found, back off to Trigram (first two words of Trigram are the last two words of the sentence).
- If no Trigram is found, back off to Bigram (first word of Bigram is the last word of the sentence)
- If no Bigram is found, back off to the most common word with highest frequency 'the' is returned.

## Shiny Application
A Shiny application was developed based on the next word prediction model described previously as shown below.
